                At Rising India School of Excellence (RISE) Preschool, we are
                building the future of India. Starting with its youngest minds.
                As Goa's first truly international preschool, we offer an
                education that transcends the classroom. Many early learning
                centres don't offer children the chance to truly explore and
                discover. This often stifles their natural sense of wonder,
                curiosity and the joy of learning - the very foundation for
                future leaders and creators. What we do is create a world of
                Risers who are confident, curious and creative through our
                proprietary D.I.S.C.O.V.E.R.Y. Mind ModelⒸ which equips young
                children with the mindset and skills to become future leaders
                and innovators.

                global powerhouse.”
                <br /><br />
                Rising India School of Excellence is not just an institution; it
                is a calling, a dream and a movement dedicated to
                nation-building. This school represents the deep-seated desire
                of a team of pedigreed professionals and acclaimed educationists
                to contribute to the progress and development of our great

                greater heights.
                <br /><br />
                In the 21st century - the age of Artificial Intelligence -
                India's trajectory is set on the path to global leadership. But
                for this vision to become a reality, we need thinkers,
                innovators and leaders who can make a difference. This requires
                education that goes beyond classrooms and textbooks. We need
                transformative education for a rising India. Education which
                modernises knowledge, and complements it with skills, character
                and meta-learning.
                <br /><br />
                Through a progressive and dynamic curriculum that blends modern
                teaching methodologies, state-of-the-art infrastructure and
                dedicated faculty, we are committed to fostering the development
                of holistic well-rounded individuals who are prepared to thrive
                in a fast-changing world.

              <p>
                We believe that every child has the potential to grow and
                evolve. Abilities aren't set in stone - they're skills that can
                be nurtured and developed. Which is why, we don't set
                limitations and cultivate boundless opportunities instead. Here,
                each day is a fresh opportunity to uncover new strengths and
                surpass expectations. With the right guidance and encouragement,
                every child can unlock their true potential and reach new
                heights.
